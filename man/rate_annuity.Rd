rate_annuity(value_age, value_specifications)
}
\arguments{
\item{value_age}{These are the choices for the age of the annuitant, namely: `55`, `60`, `65`, `70` or `75`. The ensuing annuity rates imply that the annuity begins to be paid immediately and thereafter on a monthly basis.}

\item{value_specifications}{These are the specifications available, varying by: whether the annuity is on a single basis or a joint basis (and, if so, whether the last remaining spouse receives half or all of the annuity); whether the annuity is guaranteed for ten years or not; and whether the payments will escalate at 3% pa or not. In all, the following combinations are available: 
\describe{
  \item{single_simple}{single, level rate, no guarantee}
  \item{single_guaranteed}{single, level rate, guaranteed}
  \item{single_escalating}{single, escalating rate, no guarantee}
  \item{half_simple}{joint, half upon first death, level rate, no guarantee}
  \item{full_simple}{joint, all upon first death, level rate, no guarantee}
  \item{half_escalating}{joint, half upon first death, escalating rate, no guarantee}
}}
